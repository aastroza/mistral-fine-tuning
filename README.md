# Mistral Fine-tuning Hackaton

## Description

Generative AI is revolutionizing communication worldwide. However, current models are predominantly trained in standard English, neglecting other languages like the unique Spanish dialect spoken in Chile. This dialect is considered highly disruptive globally due to its rapid evolution in spoken and written language, creation of new words, and flexible rules of pronunciation. Adapting AI models to this Chilean dialect poses a challenge, requiring a curated database reflecting the language's evolution for accuracy. Chile boasts a rich tradition in humor, showcased annually at the Vi√±a del Mar Festival since 1960. Leveraging the Mistral API, we created a database with 3,509 jokes from the festival, used to fine-tune a model generating jokes based on keywords. An additional step involved mapping the mentalization levels in joke structure for quality control. A website was developed to compare our model against others by presenting pairs of jokes for user preference assessment. Based on votes from hundreds of Chileans, our model currently leads in the ELO ranking.
